Additional Considerations
Security
API Key Protection:

Do not hardcode API keys in the codebase.
Use environment variables or secure vaults.
Sensitive Data Handling:

Ensure any sensitive user data is handled securely.
Compliance
Terms of Service:

Review Alpaca's API terms and ensure your usage complies.
Financial Regulations:

Include disclaimers stating that the application is for informational purposes and not financial advice.
Performance Optimization
Efficient Data Usage:

Cache data when appropriate to reduce API calls.
Asynchronous Processing:

Consider using asynchronous programming to handle API requests without blocking the main thread.
User Experience
Feedback Mechanisms:

Provide clear feedback to users for actions taken.
Error Messages:

Display user-friendly error messages.
